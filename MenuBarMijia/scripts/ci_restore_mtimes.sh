# Stamp each tracked file with the commit time of its last change.
# A git checkout sets every mtime to "now", so a restored Swift/Xcode build
# cache treats every input as dirty. The build database records these stamps;
# the next run that stamps the same unchanged files can skip them.
# Requires a non-shallow checkout (fetch-depth: 0); a depth-1 clone reports
# every file as introduced by HEAD.
# `-m` lists the files a merge commit changed. Without it a merge keeps the
# older stamp of a file it brought in, so a cached object from before the merge
# looks current and the link fails on the new symbols it never built.
